I read a post a few weeks back espousing the need for a personal blog. If I find that page again, I'll have it linked *here* - but the gist of the author's reasons were this:

- It's good for organising thoughts.
- It makes you a better writer.

I am (almost infamously I'm sure) awful at maintaining a blog. The issues that I've found with keeping one up to date is that, most of the time, there's not actually that much going on in my life that I feel is worth making a post about. I'd fallen into a hole of just keeping to myself, and believing that, even if I did actually write something... well, what's the point? Who would read it?

Back in October 2022, when Elon Musk bought Twitter, I finally took the plunge and dropped it for good in favor of [a profile on the Fediverse](https://social.thegeneral.chat/@Splatsune). I fought my hardest to try to get some of my friends there to follow me, but instead a lot of friends from there either stayed on Twitter (now X) or simply quit the microblogging scene entirely. (Not hard to see why - Twitter was a reminder to me that those services *thrive* on making people stress every second of every day forever.)

But I've been decently happy on my little corner of the fediverse, and it's got me thinking again about connecting a blog to the platform, and having somewhere where I can just sorta... nerd out into the ether.

I was considering returning to regular YouTube stuff instead, but, I don't think I can really make that effort again.

Maybe some of the things I had planned, I can put here instead...
