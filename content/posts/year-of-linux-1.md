Late last year I removed my Windows install for what seems like the last time, opting to move myself onto Linux for good.

I originally planned to stick with [NixOS](https://nixos.org), but as much as that kind of system has been really interesting and... oddly fun (not to mention being able to configure a system remotely is a great concept), I have settled on [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org) once more.

Being that I'm about to help my father give Linux a shot (not permanently, I think, but at least giving him a taste of what's possible without Microsoft, or specifically, its creeping tendrils of privacy invasion[^1]), I thought I would recount the steps that it took to get me to this point, starting with this initial post, detailing how I got introduced to Linux, and how I got Arch installed on the various machines I will be using.

[^1]: Wow, I think I just went full neckbeard there.

## My History with Linux

I was first exposed to desktop Linux in high school, as I was getting into my teenage years. (Holy shit that's 19 years ago...) I had just moved from Victoria down to the small town of Rosebury, Tasmania - an awkward autistic boy about to be thrown into the deep end of life.

Despite the old-fashionedness of the town, the high school I went to had a computer lab with Windows XP, and it was relatively locked down, as high school computers would be - I had a small clique of nerdy friends who liked to mess around with the computers and try to do stuff on the network. I remember really getting into the idea of [PortableApps.com](https://portableapps.com/), and keeping a USB stick of programs so that I didn't *need* to use the school software - for example so I could use Firefox or Google Chrome. Around the same time I discovered 'free games' like Armagetron Advanced and BZFlag, which I remember having a great time with both.

One day, one of these nerdy friends brought in a CD containing [Ubuntu 7.04: Feisty Fawn](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/7.04Tour), shut down the Windows OS running on one of the school PCs, and booted up into the GNOME 2 environment of the live CD. I was amazed! This was so wild and new to me - this looked almost nothing like Windows! I was hooked.

Later I would order a CD of my own. (I forget if the CD service was free, or if you paid a small fee to support the development of the distribution.) And from there I started to gently explore and prod at the world of Linux software - but usually it would just be me dipping my toes in the water, seeing what it was like.

As I grew, I'd play with the occasional dual-boot or VM, trying different distros (one online friend somehow convinced me to try Gentoo, for a spell - I managed but I was heavily dependent on them, and eventually I got overwhelmed with how daunting the experience was, in my late teens) and always kinda keeping it in the back of my head. My distro choice never really kept to one place, I'd shuffle between Fedora or Ubuntu, then tried Arch Linux (appropriately, on an *IBM* ThinkPad R32 - its battery eventually degraded to being unusable).

These experiments would eventually end the same way - I'd try to do something with which I had no experience, or I did a system update, and the environment would break in some spectacular way. I'd struggle with trying to fix it, give up, and head back to Windows.

[WINE (*WINE Is Not an Emulator*)](https://winehq.org) already existed for many of those years where I was prodding and tinkering with Linux
