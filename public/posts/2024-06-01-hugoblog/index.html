    <p>I read a post a few weeks back espousing the need for a personal blog. If I find that page again, I&rsquo;ll have it linked <em>here</em> - but the gist of the author&rsquo;s reasons were this:</p>
<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s good for organising thoughts.</li>
<li>It makes you a better writer.</li>
</ul>
<p>I am (almost infamously I&rsquo;m sure) awful at maintaining a blog. The issues that I&rsquo;ve found with keeping one up to date is that, most of the time, there&rsquo;s not actually that much going on in my life that I feel is worth making a post about. I&rsquo;d fallen into a hole of just keeping to myself, and believing that, even if I did actually write something&hellip; well, what&rsquo;s the point? Who would read it?</p>
<p>Back in October 2022, when Elon Musk bought Twitter, I finally took the plunge and dropped it for good in favor of <a href="https://social.thegeneral.chat/@Splatsune">a profile on the Fediverse</a>. I fought my hardest to try to get some of my friends there to follow me, but instead a lot of friends from there either stayed on Twitter (now X) or simply quit the microblogging scene entirely. (Not hard to see why - Twitter was a reminder to me that those services <em>thrive</em> on making people stress every second of every day forever.)</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ve been decently happy on my little corner of the fediverse, and it&rsquo;s got me thinking again about connecting a blog to the platform, and having somewhere where I can just sorta&hellip; nerd out into the ether.</p>
<p>I was considering returning to regular YouTube stuff instead, but, I don&rsquo;t think I can really make that effort again.</p>
<p>Maybe some of the things I had planned, I can put here instead&hellip;</p>
